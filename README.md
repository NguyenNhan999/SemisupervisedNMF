# SemisupervisedNMF
Implementation of the semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization. 
This algorithm is proposed in the paper named "A Unified Semi-Supervised Community Detection Framework Using Latent Space Graph Regularization". This implementation in Python using Tensorflow framework is used to compare this method's performace.
